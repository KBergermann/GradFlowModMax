Gradient flow-based modularity maximization for community detection in multiplex networks

This repository contains Matlab codes to reproduce the numerical experiments from the manuscript

 [1] Kai Bergermann and Martin Stoll. Gradient flow-based modularity maximization for community detection in multiplex networks, Preprint, 2024.

The three m-files S1_*, S2_*, S3_* directly produce the output of the examples shown in Subsections 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 from [1], respectively.
The directory GenLouvain-master is a placeholder for the Generalized Louvain codes [2] that our methods MPBTV and DGFM3 are compared to.
